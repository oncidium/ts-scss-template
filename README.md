# Typescript + SCSS Template
## This program uses Gulp and Browser Sync to create a basic web dev environment.

## Overview
I spend a fair amount of time prototyping using online code editors like codepen.io. I usually run with typescript as the javascript pre-processor and scss for my cascading stylesheets, but there's nothing quite like using the IDE of your choice to write javascript & css.

## Installation
First install the dependencies.
``` npm install ```
Then run Gulp using the npm script located in the package.json.
``` npm run start ```
